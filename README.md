# Time taken:
  : The project took just under 72 hrs for full functionality.
  
# User privacy:
  : We do not collect any user data apart from account activity and that includes messages sent to a user.Messages from anyone are anonymous and the receiver only has      record of the time a message was sent and never by who.
  
# Held-back functionalities:
  : User tracking(devices,account third-party sharing etc), which we can never deploy as it violates our privacy policy and the whole project idea.
  : Real time logs keeping, which as well we can't deploy.
